fully migrate to an automated system. bring back the transformation team in finance. a team should oversee this, instead of having the transformation team in the division level as this encourages a

goes through board approval which is then not supported with proper documents or guidance on how to proceed. financial tools are available but onboarding on what data to input are not clear. the

more diversity in voice and decision making, as currently there is only one key figurehead deciding how decisions are made, how programs should be approached, and how people should be appraised. there is a tangible air of hesitation to speak and fear of being rebuked in some parts of the organization, and it has crippled many talented resources and promising initiatives. there needs to be more conscious effort to empower teams across different levels of the organization, as currently creativity and empowerment is being stifled by fear of not being able to anticipate exactly what the top leaders will want to know/hear. this emanates from the top and is a shadow that is cast over teams. as a result, teams tend to be reactive, and there is some toxicity and negativity as teams start to finger point for fear of reprisal. this has already triggered resignations and induced stress on many talents.\",\"there are too many restructurings. in my 7 months, i have witnessed at least 2

poorly executed with long timelines and high internal turnover.\",\"there is a severe lack of communication between teams in the company. everyone prioritizes themselves first and i get the impression that they would bring other teams down if it would lift themselves up. it's an unfortunate observation in a company that brands itself as very progressive in the tech industry. we need more people that are driven, team players, and more pragmatic. it's more disappointing that this type of egoistic behavior and gatekeeping can be found in our leaders, and the culture exhibited by our leaders trickle down to their one downs. i'm hoping the company can figure out initiatives to remove this toxic culture and improve communication and collaboration between leaders so we can better cultivate working relationships between teams.\",\"i've been here for a year. there are things done right but there are a lot of things that are inefficient. i chose leadership because there are a lot of things

is known today and how far it has been successful. i am blessed to be a part of this excellent and growing company that always offers what is best in serving filipinos.\",\"since we cannot hire more manpower, the best move to do is plan efficiently, organize better system operations and follow the processes and the said plans so we don't topple and get burned out. given the fact that we don't have enough resources to do the legwork, i hope other manager_tags can work as a whole unit working for gcash as an entire brand. we have so many upper management people who keep competing with each other and it gets difficult who to follow in the end. be accountable for what's within your scope and stop overstepping on others and their respective jobs. it is not efficient and instead; less empowering, aggravating and disrespectful.\",\"my immediate_supervisor_tag is the only reason i'm considering leaving the company. she is highly emotional, subjective, inconsiderate and has double standards.\",\"have things look good in screenshots! say im investing in crypto and earned/lost and i want to show my friends, i want something aesthetically pleasing to show people in turn promoting gcash.\",\"gcash has been gradually acquiring a bad reputation as having lots of issues compared to our competitors. i suggest we focus primarily on addressing and minimizing these issues before anything else. focus on improving our main products and services first.\",\"go back to what we mean by financial inclusion. we talk about revenue so much that we forget about our vision, which is really about bringing finance to every filipino. we're in the best position to develop this space as the market leader--can't we be doing more to push forward the ph's agenda for financial inclusion?\",\"empower manager_tags by giving them the complete information they need and giving them enough but justifiable time, support, and resources to deliver on optimum results.\",\"more improvement on ticket handling on gcash help center and gchamp.\",\"let's continue the rigor and passion to deliver the best technology for the products and services that we offer. it is the tech that we can control, tweak, and play with to differentiate our offering. imagine if our tech can have a single unified dashboard so that a customer would know that gcash isn't just for spending but also for investments. a dashboard that shows one's spend (pay bills, send money, glife, etc), savings (gcash wallet, gsave), and investments (funds, stocks, etc) coupled with charts and education materials.\",\"gcash app having more security features allowing both customers and company safe from fraudsters.\",\"data privacy and misg are the poorest collaborators in the company. they prefer to work in complete silos only preferring to work with teams through convoluted forms that are time consuming and repetitive. for example, for any project / product execution each of these teams require separate assessments and forms to fill out despite having very similar end points: data privacy - privacy impact assessment misg - project security review (psr), third party security review (tpsr) although i understand that risk assessment is important, it doesn't have to be this repetitive. more forms to fill out only slows down the company but doesn't actually reduce risk. these teams also have a poor understanding of how standard gcash products are executed with merchants and does not work to create a thorough and long lasting understanding of how these products work. this leads to several cases of these teams having to repeat the same assessments for similar executions.\",\"one huge issue facing gcash and its customers is the rampant cases of fraud and scams being perpetrated in the philippines. these negative events greatly impact customer perception and reduce their confidence in fintech. gcash should be able to better acquire new users and grow the usage of its products if it is able to eliminate or greatly reduce these risks for customers.\",\"gcash is mostly associated with its issues on social media which can be taken advantage of by its competitors thus a need to address it.\",\"we still need gcash to be a reliable option when doing transactions with other people. like when sending amounts to a deal you made online, we should have a solution to the amount of scams, or at least lessen/prevent them.\",\"due to gcash popularity, it is now used as a tool for scamming other people. we should find a way to significantly decrease those scamming cases.\",\"find more ways for gcash customers to access customer service without having to worry about the cost of calling the hotline.\",\"gcash is on top, it will be filled with issues related to the company by competitors that will try to bring it down.\",\"i suggest our customers can get gpoints or grebates for every transaction - send money, pay bills etc even like .01 cents that can be accumulated and can convert to actual gcash and can be added to their gcash wallet balance. this is the usual trending now. customer can get points/rebates every time she/he uses the services or buys goods.\",\"please have an information management system. keep our employees constantly and frequently informed about what's happening. what's new, what are the problems, how can each of one help. what are the overlapping events, who should be involved. digital information or information through immersion will help us understand and work with each other better. an effective info mgmt system will make us feel like our knowledge and understanding matter to the company and that we are important. it will help break silos and help us be proud not only about the products, but because we know what to say about the products. we can help educate more people, more customers, and make more gcash ambassadors.\",\"if we can effectively communicate what's the mission, vision and future of gcash to filipino people and to the rest of the world, then the people will patronize using gcash.\",\"continue finding new ways to reach all filipinos and make gcash part of their everyday life.\",\"open, accessible repository of onboarding materials for gcash employees (e.g. who's responsible for which product, available learning materials for the different products) workday's org chart function is really helpful not under collaboration, but for total rewards, the incentives and bonuses are very very much appreciated and recognized to be discretionary but it might help in people's morale and motivation if the conditions for clawbacks are lessened.\",\"being the best at the role we have is not reflective of being a good people manager_tag, a good people manager_tag should understand that different people have different approaches and different needs. i hope my immediate_supervisor_tag would avoid comparing me with my peers and misunderstanding me for things that i know or speak.\",\"more digital wallets are emerging so we need to position ourselves as the best option for customers. gcash is also heavily affected by the presence of scammers so we need to become and appear more secure and trustworthy.\",\"sooner or later i believe gcash will achieve financial inclusion for all. we might consider expanding on having companies as our source of income. a good example is managing their monthly bills with interest.\",\"i think we've won the end consumers' favor already, however we need to dig deeper on the triggers/motivators of our partner merchants from formal to informal segments to encourage or shift them to use gcash.\",\"ensure that our products perform at their best given the scale and growth we want to achieve. from a marketing standpoint, i think the most powerful proposition is a product that works at a standard that speaks for itself. being a part of gcash makes me proud to tell people of all the innovations we're making, but net of all our efforts, what we should be working towards is making people proud to be using gcash.\",\"most filipinos just really want to maximize their earnings and savings.\",\"invest more on hiring employees to solve problems raised by gcash users.\",\"promote people who are with gcash for a long time already.\",\"if the question is directed to external customers - gcash users) i guess, gcash app's downtime/system maintenance should be scheduled/communicated ahead via various channels - sms, official social media account - so customers are well informed, except if downtime is unplanned.\",\"implementing globally recognized security standards to further improve and strengthen the control features of gcash to boost customers' trust to our products and services including those of the regulatory bodies.\",\"need to utilize the respective teams/squad/tribe to have a strong accountability and responsibility to their roles ensuring that they cooperate and work hand in hand with all the cross functional team. this will help to resolve problems manifesting in production for a long period of time affecting gcash reputation to be bad due to the long resolution planning and implementation - mostly being deprio because of new products/project.\",\"i think at the end, we have a social responsibility to be at the forefront of allowing what to be offered vs not to a certain user base. general example is gambling. until we have mature models to assess wins-losses of the users - it would be prudent to limit access to potentially harmful industries. this is beyond what is required by law now, but if we have the capability to do something socially responsible geared to the right direction. this would show users why to trust us.\",\"we know and understand gcash needs to strike the iron while it's hot to keep our growth momentum going. while work balance is appreciated, continuous rewards and competitive pay adjustments are needed to make up for the lack of balance.\",\"thank you, gcash!\",\"more exposure to grassroot setting and see how gcash can be an enabler.\",\"hear out our gcash pera outlet partners. there is a need to further improve the product that will differentiate us from what our personal wallet provides. as of now, personal wallet is more advantageous vs pera outlet (buy load, billers) more options in pw than po.\",\"spreading awareness regarding how to secure their gcash account from scammers/hackers.\",\"people manager_tags and leaders must talk about, reinforce, and model gcash values \\u200b\\u200band ways of working. in my limited experience, gcash values \\u200b\\u200bwere only discussed during the new hire onboarding. furthermore, they must walk the talk.\",\"with the difficulties that arise when an employee

forms to fill out only slows down the company but doesn't actually reduce risk. these teams also have a poor understanding of how standard gcash products are executed with merchants and does not work

company and its leadership team are very strong when it comes to making tactical decisions and actions but is very poor with strategic and long-term actions and commitments. long-term investment on people (development, work tools, performance) is lacking. we keep on-boarding talented people but fail in capitalizing on their strengths or truly understanding their motivators in order to retain them. the company would also benefit from transforming existing leaders into strong strategic leaders or in assigning strong strategic leaders in critical roles. and ensure that the culture is driven from the top and monitored to ensure commitment and understanding at all levels.\",\"leaders should be role models. they should be appointed based on competence, knowledge and skills and not on reputation. they should exercise leadership skills, transparent, motivating and most importantly professional in dealing with their subordinates.\",\"putting a balance between quality and speed. fully adapting to the envisioned culture throughout the whole organization.\",\"i believe that continuous growth in my current role and in my soft and hard skills would make all the difference in my love for my job and the company. i want to continue to grow and improve my skills in a place that not only encourages it, but fosters it.\",\"gating processes - seems to be rushed to present, effort goes to waste because plans are just breezed through due to time constraints timelines to go live with a campaign are fast but approval processes to open and request for budget have so many layers. there's also the barrier of having 50m cap for campaigns and anything beyond it goes through board approval which is then not supported with proper documents or guidance on how to proceed. financial tools are available but onboarding on what data to input are not clear. the onboarding is just on how to navigate memoapp or pwp template but not how to make a business case.\",\"it has gotten better recently, but overall, i think we try to do too much and spread our focus to thinly.\",\"we grew the company so fast since the pandemic. given this, there might be some leaders who need to further grow into their roles. hence, they will need mentoring to be an uplifting and inspiring line manager_tag for the benefit of the team they are leading.\",\"need more people on our team.\",\"there is a severe lack of communication between teams in the company. everyone prioritizes themselves first and i get the impression that they would bring other teams down if it would lift themselves up. it's an unfortunate observation in a company that brands itself as very progressive in the tech industry. we need more people that are driven, team players, and more pragmatic. it's more disappointing that this type of egoistic behavior and gatekeeping can be found in our leaders, and the culture exhibited by our leaders trickle down to their one downs. i'm hoping the company can figure out initiatives to remove this toxic culture and improve communication and collaboration between leaders so we can better cultivate working relationships between teams.\",\"we need more diversity in voice and decision making, as currently there is only one key figurehead deciding how decisions are made, how programs should be approached, and how people should be appraised. there is a tangible air of hesitation to speak and fear of being rebuked in some parts of the organization, and it has crippled many talented resources and promising initiatives. there needs to be more conscious effort to empower teams across different levels of the organization, as currently creativity and empowerment is being stifled by fear of not being able to anticipate exactly what the top leaders will want to know/hear. this emanates from the top and is a shadow that is cast over teams. as a result, teams tend to be reactive, and there is some toxicity and negativity as teams start to finger point for fear of reprisal. this has already triggered resignations and induced stress on many talents.\",\"lack of comprehensive onboarding plans cause massive stress when starting a new job here - process are not agile with the amount of work needed to be done - raci is not clear sometimes - too much work done by 1 person. no work-life balance causing lack of peace of mind during leaves and weekends - grind

autonomous team, leadership should trust and nurture self management of the team, that they should be included in every decision made.\",\"i've been here for a year. there are things done right but

poorly executed with long timelines and high internal turnover.\",\"reduce approval culture. reduce bureaucracy. have a more lean mindset. refine existing processes and practices and remove any unnecessary ones. clean up and unify resources. embed quality of work within normal work processes instead of having approval gates at the end. revisit processes and practices annually to ensure we only have the processes we need. do proper rca/eda to address the cause of the issue instead of putting up band aid solutions like just adding additional approvals every time an issue is met.\",\"leaders should always be objective in making decisions and not influenced by personal feelings, interests, biases, and perspectives. we hope that decisions will be based on verifiable facts, numbers, and all stakeholders' interests.\",\"leaders lead by example.\",\"clearer and more transparent goal setting and checking in to see we are on track instead of just rushing this all at the year end evaluation.\",\"we need to be better at resourcing and creative solving to get the job done -- there have been too many instances where key initiatives have been pushed back because of the lack of readiness or initiative to 'make it work'.\",\"there are too many restructurings. in my 7 months, i have witnessed at least 2 already. there is job security but i'm a little skeptical with role security.\",\"some heads are also good as individual contributors but need to improve as a people manager_tags. please encourage constant communication within teams. set the tone from the top. without proper communication, the team will work in silos with minimal coordination. encourage cross-functional thinking and decrease band aid solutions. perform business process reviews, identify pain points, and set our big hairy audacious goal to fully migrate to an automated system. bring back the transformation team in finance. a team should oversee this, instead of having the transformation team in the division level as this encourages a silo mindset. encourage and empower people not just to automate manual processes but to step back and utilize what is the available technology (sap, a , rpa, bi) and how we can properly use it.\",\"incumbent fund transfer product head is very incompetent, has poor judgment when it comes to decision making and strategic planning, and doesn't care about the career development of his subordinates at all, so our team is very low on morale now -_-.\",\"being the best at the role we have is not reflective of being a good people manager_tag, a good people manager_tag should understand that different people have different approaches and different needs. i hope my immediate_supervisor_tag would avoid comparing me with my peers and misunderstanding me for things that i know or speak.\",\"i believe existing employees have already proven themselves to the company but it seems the company is just hiring new bosses instead of training the people to be able to lead and focus on their growth. leaders should be able to train their subordinates on how to be a future leader not hire new people who do not know fully the company... we usually end up teaching our new bosses about the product instead of us being thought on how to be future leaders... i hope we can have a chance to grow in the company and not get left behind at the bottom.\",\"i want to grow

improve processes by having employees with broader and deeper experience; recalibrate current employee levels and experience in the company against the market or other departments/companies and add more senior/experienced employees if needed.\",\"in a fast paced company, people need time to rest well, especially since now we have also incorporated all meetings/communication digitally. boundaries are now blurred so people don't get enough rest and down time. in the long run, this sprinting is not sustainable. people will grow tired and get burned out and leave. if the company truly values \\u200b\\u200bits people, give them more down time and flexibility.\",\"good communications within the teams and tribes to keep the focus on goals and objectives of the company. escalation process must be implemented and followed.\",\"people in tech are full and loaded. working for a min of 10 hours daily (meetings are at 4-5 hours daily), including weekends and holidays. 1 resource can handle more than 5 projects at a time, giving 20% \\u200b\\u200bper day per task. there is no work-life-balance anymore. bosses have no respect for employees' time and messages thru telegram until 10 pm, weekends even sundays, holidays, and even sick leaves. draining and to a level of anxiety. training is not enough and processes are still maturing. in return, people will leave. this gives the team who were left to pickup and train a new one again. i hope management sees this and gives credit to people who decide to stay longer and just survive. for lt to be a bit forgiving and more forward-thinking especially to those who are still in the company.\",\"leaders should lead by example.\",\"expose everyone with equal opportunity into learning and development programs being offered

are some old employees who resign due to salary, i think the problem is they let the employee resign without a counter offer higher than his / her new job. then will hire a senior dev with much higher salary (not sure if it's not counter or they really don't want it anymore because of stress at work). then that new employee is having a hard time because my project and deadlines immediately on the projects that need to be met. there are things that cannot be obtained by quick onboarding / empowerment. most of those who have resigned are those who have my broad knowledge about applications due to the length of time and the number of projects they have handled. its very hard especially in consultation or production issues.\",\"company wants to be a lot of things and deliver new services but no sufficient resources to execute these projects. if you're not in the top 10 or 20, it's hard to ask for resources. in turn, this is demotivating because we all strive hard to build products which may not be revenue-generating but will still impact our services greatly.\",\"considering i've been with the company for over 7 years, i might have already settled for where i am. given the many different opportunities still within the company, i don't feel empowered to try for them as i feel under-equipped to take on the role.\",\"i observe some leaders are reactive in making decisions

misg - project security review (psr), third party security review (tpsr) although i understand that risk assessment is important, it doesn't have to be this repetitive. more forms to fill out only slows down the company but doesn't actually reduce risk. these teams also have a poor understanding of how standard gcash products are executed with merchants and does not work to create a thorough

security review (psr), third party security review (tpsr) although i understand that risk assessment is important, it doesn't have to be this repetitive. more forms to fill out only slows down the company but doesn't actually reduce risk. these teams also have a poor understanding of how standard gcash products are executed with merchants and does not work to create a thorough and long lasting

with a campaign are fast but approval processes to open and request for budget have so many layers. there's also the barrier of having 50m cap for campaigns and anything beyond it goes through board approval which is then not supported with proper documents or guidance on how to proceed. financial tools are available but onboarding on what data to input are not clear. the onboarding is just on

subordinates on how to be a future leader not hire new people who do not know fully the company... we usually end up teaching our new bosses about the product instead of us being thought on how to be future leaders... i hope we can have a chance to grow in the company and not get left behind at the bottom.\",\"enhance the engagement within the teams, change the work style and team accountability.\",\"we need more diversity in voice and decision making, as currently there is only one key figurehead deciding how decisions are made, how programs should be approached, and how people should be appraised. there is a tangible air of hesitation to speak and fear of being rebuked in some parts of the organization, and it has crippled many talented resources and promising initiatives. there needs to be more conscious effort to empower teams across different levels of the organization, as currently creativity and empowerment is being stifled by fear of not being able to anticipate exactly what the top leaders will want to know/hear. this emanates from the top and is a shadow that is cast over teams. as a result, teams tend to be reactive, and there is some toxicity and negativity as teams start to finger point for fear of reprisal. this has already triggered resignations and induced stress on many talents.\",\"i observe some leaders are reactive in making decisions without asking any context first.\",\"in a fast paced company, people need time to rest well, especially since now we have also incorporated all meetings/communication digitally. boundaries are now blurred so people don't get enough rest and down time. in the long run, this sprinting is not sustainable. people will grow tired and get burned out and leave. if the company truly values

senior dev with much higher salary (not sure if it's not counter or they really don't want it anymore because of stress at work). then that new employee is having a hard time because my project and deadlines immediately on the projects that need to be met. there are things that cannot be obtained by quick onboarding / empowerment. most of those who have resigned are those who have my broad knowledge about applications due to the length of time and the number of projects they have handled. its very hard especially in consultation or production issues.\",\"people in tech are full and loaded. working for a min of 10 hours daily (meetings are at 4-5 hours daily), including weekends and holidays. 1 resource can handle more than 5 projects at a time, giving 20% \\u200b\\u200bper day per task. there is no work-life-balance anymore. bosses have no respect for employees' time and messages thru telegram until 10 pm, weekends even sundays, holidays, and even sick leaves. draining and to a level of anxiety. training is not enough and processes are still maturing. in return, people will leave. this gives the team who were left to pickup and train a new one again. i hope management sees this and gives credit to people who decide to stay longer and just survive. for lt to be a bit forgiving and more forward-thinking especially to those who are still in the company.\",\"i think

every time an issue is met.\",\"in terms of leadership, i think some of the leaders should take empowerment on how to handle their teams well.\",\"there is a severe lack of communication between teams in the company. everyone prioritizes themselves first and i get the impression that they would bring other teams down if it would lift themselves up. it's an unfortunate observation in a company that brands itself as very progressive in the tech industry. we need more people that are driven, team players, and more pragmatic. it's more disappointing that this type of egoistic behavior and gatekeeping can be found in our leaders, and the culture exhibited by our leaders trickle down to their one downs. i'm hoping the company can figure out initiatives to remove this toxic culture and improve communication and collaboration between leaders so we can better cultivate working relationships between teams.\",\"expose everyone with equal opportunity into learning and development

security review (tpsr) although i understand that risk assessment is important, it doesn't have to be this repetitive. more forms to fill out only slows down the company but doesn't actually reduce

immediate action and they are left hanging because they don't know if they will get their money back or not. example of issues: (1) money was sent to the wrong number due to typo error (2) scan to pay was deducted twice (3) had a cash in using instapay from bank to gcash, it was successful in your bank but gcash account did not receive the money.\",\"customer support especially in terms of

doesn't have to be this repetitive. more forms to fill out only slows down the company but doesn't actually reduce risk. these teams also have a poor understanding of how standard gcash products are
